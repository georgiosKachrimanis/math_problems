<h1>Welcome to Mathy</h1>

This is an application I created for my daughter. 
The main goal is to give her some small challenge with the basic mathematical functions, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and of course Division.

- Addition: Generates two numbers between 0 and 1000.
- Subtraction: Generates two numbers ensuring the minuend is greater than or equal to the subtrahend.
- Multiplication: Generates two numbers between 0 and 10.
- Division: Generates two numbers where the dividend is a multiple of the divisor.

Of course you can adjust the difficulty if you want.
For example the addition can be numbers between 1-10 or 1-100 etc.
The same can be said for Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
